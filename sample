# Each line in the 'to' list must have email:address@domain.com The rest of the
# 'to' line can have tokens (comma-delimited name value pairs e.g.
# name:value,name:value). You can supply multiple emails in the 'email' line
# separated by semicolons. 
# Special Tags: 
#   file: will insert the contents of the file specified in the value
#     e.g. ([file]name:path)
#   attachment: takes a file and inserts it at the end of the message. This tag
#     should not not get a token in the message body. e.g.
#     ([attachment]name:path)
